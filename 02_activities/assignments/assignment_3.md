# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Let’s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```

    This visualization is inaccessible because it is incomplete. If you look at the source of the information, you will see that there is 
    a lot of data that we cannot see in the dashboard.

    Reproducibility promotes transparency and reliability by ensuring that the visualizations can be recreated by others using the same 
    data and methods. From this perspective, we can say that this data is reproducible because we have access to the source of the 
    information and can make our visualizations.

    Equity ensures that the visualizations are fair and unbiased, represent a variety of perspectives, and do not reinforce stereotypes 
    or misconceptions. But if a visualization that only includes the European region is made, there is a bias here.



    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)? 


    For accessibility, I would increase the number of countries in the visualization. In the part where the happiness bars are shown, 
    I would make the negative part red. In the map part, I would write the name of the country above the happiness rate.

    I don't think there is an issue with the reproducibility of the data. The data is open source and anyone can revise 
    the visualization as they wish.

    I think that the fact that only Europe was chosen is enough to show us that this visualization is not fair.

    Colors that remind the tennis court and sport are used. The size of the texts that provide information about the graph in each graph 
    is very well adjusted. The information written as text also provides sufficient information about the graph. When we look at all these, 
    it is possible to say that the information is accessible.

    The data is open source and anyone can revise the visualization as they wish and is therefore reproducible.

    The fact that it does not discriminate between genders and places people in the graph according to their success order shows that the visualization is free from bias and fair.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)? 

    I think the only thing that would make the visualization more effective would be to remove the gender and country boxes 
    from the table with the tennis players' names. Maybe I would shorten the text in the graphs a bit more because there is 
    a lot of information.

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
